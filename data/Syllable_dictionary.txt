thick 1

the 1

what 1
so 1

that 1

day 1
as 1
i 1
unwarily 4
did 1
gaze 1

eyes 1
my 1
love's 1
immortal 3
light 1
the 1
whiles 1
my 1
stonished 4

stood 1
in 1

through 1
sweet 1
illusion 3
of 1
her 1

how 1
in 1
her 1
glancing 2
sight 1
legions 2
of 1
loves 1
with 1
little 2
wings 1
did 1
fly 1
darting 2
their 1
deadly 2
arrows 2
fiery 3
bright 1
at 1
every 3
rash 1
beholder 3
passing 2
by 1
one 1
of 1
those 1
archers 2
closely 2
i 1
did 1
spy 1
aiming 2
his 1
arrow 2
at 1
my 1
very 2
heart 1
when 1
suddenly 3
with 1
twinkle 2
of 1
her 1
eye 1
the 1
damsel 2
broke 1
his 1
misintended 4
dart 1

she 1
not 1
so 1
done 1
sure 1
i 1
had 1
been 1
slain 1

as 1
it 1
was 1
i 1
hardly 2
scaped 2
with 1
pain 1
the 1
glorious 3
portrait 2
of 1
that 1
angel's 2
face 1

to 1
amaze 2
weak 1
men's 1
confused 2
skill 1

this 1
world's 1
worthless 2
glory 2

embase 2
what 1
pen 1
what 1
pencil 2
can 1
express 2
her 1
fill 1
for 1
though 1

colours 4
could 1

that 1
like 1
arrows 2
glide 1
the 1
charming 2
smiles 1
that 1
rob 1
sense 1
from 1
the 1
heart 1
the 1
lovely 2
pleasance 4
and 1
the 1
lofty 2
pride 1
cannot 2
expressed 2
be 1
by 1
any 2

greater 2
craftsman's 2
hand 1

need 1
that 1

the 1
life 1
of 1
things 1
indeed 2
the 1
rolling 2
wheel 1
that 1
runneth 2
often 2
round 1

with 1
many 2
a 1
dropping 2
tear 1

her 1
hard 1
heart 1
that 1
she 1

my 1

to 1
hear 1

look 1
with 1
pity 2
on 1

painful 2
smart 1

when 1
i 1
plead 1
she 1
bids 1
me 1
play 1
my 1
part 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
weep 1
she 1
says 1
tears 1
are 1
but 1
water 2
and 1
when 1
i 1
sigh 1
she 1
says 1
i 1
know 1
the 1
art 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
wail 1
she 1
turns 1
herself 2
to 1
laughter 2
so 1
do 1
i 1
weep 1
and 1
wail 1
and 1
plead 1
in 1
vain 1
whiles 1
she 1
as 1
steel 1
and 1
flint 1
doth 1
still 1
remain 2
the 1
merry 2
cuckoo 2
messenger 3
of 1
spring 1
his 1
trumpet 2
shrill 1
hath 1
thrice 1
already 3
sounded 2
that 1
warns 1
all 1
lovers 2
wait 1
upon 2
their 1
king 1
who 1
now 1
is 1
coming 2
forth 1
with 1
garland 2
crowned 1
with 1
noise 1
whereof 2
the 1
choir 2
of 1
birds 1
resounded 4
their 1
anthems 2
sweet 1
devised 2
of 1
love's 1
praise 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
woods 1
their 1
echoes 2
back 1
rebounded 3
as 1
if 1
they 1
knew 1
the 1
meaning 2
of 1
their 1
lays 1
but 1
mongst 3
them 1
all 1
which 1
did 1
love's 1
honor 2
raise 1
no 1
word 1
was 1
heard 1
of 1
her 1
that 1
most 1
it 1
ought 1
but 1
she 1
his 1
precept 2
proudly 2
disobeys 3
and 1
doth 1
his 1
idle 2
message 2
set 1
at 1
nought 3
therefore 2
o 1
love 1
unless 2
she 1
turn 1
to 1
thee 1
ere 1
cuckoo 2
end 1
let 1
her 1
a 1
rebel 2
be 1
in 1
vain 1
i 1
seek 1
and 1
sue 1
to 1
her 1
for 1
grace 1
and 1
do 1
mine 1
humbled 2
heart 1
before 2
her 1
pour 1
the 1
whiles 1
her 1
foot 1
she 1
in 1
my 1
neck 1
doth 1
place 1
and 1
tread 1
my 1
life 1
down 1
in 1
the 1
lowly 2
floor 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
lion 2
that 1
is 1
lord 1
of 1
power 2
and 1
reighneth 5
over 2
every 3
beast 1
in 1
field 1
in 1
his 1
most 1
pride 1
disdaineth 4
to 1
devour 3
the 1
silly 2
lamb 1
that 1
to 1
his 1
might 1
doth 1
yield 1
but 1
she 1
more 1
cruel 2
and 1
more 1
savage 2
wild 1
then 1
either 2
lion 2
or 1
lioness 3
shames 1
not 1
to 1
be 1
with 1
guiltless 2
blood 1
defiled 2
but 1
taketh 2
glory 2
in 1
her 1
cruelness 3
fairer 2
than 1
fairest 2
let 1
none 1
ever 2
say 1
that 1
ye 1
were 1
blooded 2
in 1
a 1
yielded 2
prey 1
was 1
it 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
nature 2
or 1
of 1
art 1
which 1
tempered 2
so 1
the 1
feature 2
of 1
her 1
face 1
that 1
pride 1
and 1
meekness 2
mixed 1
by 1
equal 2
part 1
do 1
both 1
appear 2
her 1
beauty's 3
grace 1
for 1
with 1
mild 1
pleasance 4
which 1
doth 1
pride 1
displace 2
she 1
to 1
her 1
love 1
doth 1
lookers 2
eyes 1
allure 2
and 1
with 1
stern 1
countenance 3
back 1
again 2
doth 1
chase 1
their 1
looser 2
looks 1
that 1
stir 1
up 1
lusts 3
impure 2
with 1
such 1
strange 1
terms 1
her 1
eyes 1
she 1
doth 1
inure 2
that 1
with 1
one 1
look 1
she 1
doth 1
my 1
life 1
dismay 2
and 1
with 1
another 3
doth 1
it 1
straight 1
recure 2
her 1
smile 1
me 1
draws 1
her 1
frown 1
me 1
drives 1
away 2
thus 1
doth 1
she 1
train 1
and 1
teach 1
me 1
with 1
her 1
looks 1
such 1
art 1
of 1
eyes 1
i 1
never 2
read 1
in 1
books 1
this 1
holy 2
season 2
fit 1
to 1
fast 1
and 1
pray 1
men 1
to 1
devotion 3
ought 1
to 1
be 1
inclined 2
therefore 2
i 1
likewise 2
on 1
so 1
holy 2
day 1
for 1
my 1
sweet 1
saint 1
some 1
service 2
fit 1
will 1
find 1
her 1
temple 2
fair 1
is 1
built 1
within 2
my 1
mind 1
in 1
which 1
her 1
glorious 3
image 2
placed 1
is 1
on 1
which 1
my 1
thoughts 1
do 1
day 1
and 1
night 1
attend 2
like 1
sacred 2
priests 1
that 1
never 2
think 1
amiss 2
there 1
i 1
to 1
her 1
as 1
of 1
my 1
bliss 1
will 1
build 1
an 1
altar 2
to 1
appease 2
her 1
ire 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
same 1
my 1
heart 1
will 1
sacrifice 3
burning 2
in 1
flames 1
of 1
pure 1
and 1
chaste 1
desire 3
the 1
which 1
vouchsafe 2
o 1
godess 2
to 1
accept 2
amongst 2
thy 1
dearest 2
relics 2
to 1
be 1
kept 1
penelope 4
for 1
her 1
ulysses 3
sake 1
devised 2
a 1
web 1
her 1
wooers 2
to 1
deceive 2
in 1
which 1
the 1
work 1
that 1
she 1
all 1
day 1
did 1
make 1
the 1
same 1
at 1
night 1
she 1
did 1
again 2
unreave 2
such 1
subtle 2
craft 1
my 1
damsel 2
doth 1
conceive 2
suit 1
of 1
my 1
desire 3
to 1
shun 1
for 1
all 1
that 1
i 1
in 1
many 2
days 1
do 1
weave 1
in 1
one 1
short 1
hour 2
i 1
find 1
by 1
her 1
undone 2
so 1
when 1
i 1
think 1
to 1
end 1
that 1
i 1
begun 2
i 1
must 1
begin 2
and 1
never 2
bring 1
to 1
end 1
for 1
with 1
one 1
look 1
she 1
spills 1
that 1
long 1
i 1
spun 1
and 1
with 1
one 1
word 1
my 1
whole 1
year's 1
work 1
doth 1
rend 3
such 1
labour 2
like 1
the 1
spider's 3
web 1
i 1
find 1
whose 1
fruitless 2
work 1
is 1
broken 2
with 1
least 1
wind 1
when 1
i 1
behold 2
that 1
beauty's 3
wonderment 3
and 1
rare 1
perfection 3
of 1
each 1
goodly 2
part 1
of 1
nature's 2
skill 1
the 1
only 2
complement 3
i 1
honor 2
and 1
admire 2
the 1
maker's 2
art 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
feel 1
the 1
bitter 2
baleful 2
smart 1
which 1
her 1
fair 1
eyes 1
unwares 2
do 1
work 1
in 1
me 1
that 1
death 1
out 1
of 1
their 1
shiny 2
beams 1
do 1
dart 1
i 1
think 1
that 1
i 1
a 1
new 1
pandora 3
see 1
whom 1
all 1
the 1
gods 1
in 1
council 2
did 1
agree 2
into 2
this 1
sinful 2
world 1
from 1
heaven 2
to 1
send 1
that 1
she 1
to 1
wicked 2
men 1
a 1
scourge 1
should 1
be 1
for 1
all 1
their 1
faults 1
with 1
which 1
they 1
did 1
offend 2
but 1
since 1
ye 1
are 1
my 1
scourge 1
i 1
will 1
intreat 2
that 1
for 1
my 1
faults 1
ye 1
will 1
me 1
gently 2
beat 1
how 1
long 1
shall 1
this 1
like 1
dying 2
life 1
endure 2
and 1
know 1
no 1
end 1
of 1
her 1
own 1
mystery 3
but 1
waste 1
and 1
wear 1
away 2
in 1
terms 1
unsure 2
twixt 3
fear 1
and 1
hope 1
depending 3
doubtfully 3
yet 1
better 2
were 1
at 1
once 1
to 1
let 1
me 1
die 1
and 1
show 1
the 1
last 1
ensample 3
of 1
your 1
pride 1
than 1
to 1
torment 2
me 1
thus 1
with 1
cruelty 2
to 1
prove 1
your 1
power 2
which 1
i 1
too 1
well 1
have 1
tried 1
but 1
yet 1
if 1
in 1
your 1
hardened 2
breast 1
ye 1
hide 1
a 1
close 1
intent 2
at 1
last 1
to 1
show 1
me 1
grace 1
then 1
all 1
the 1
woes 1
and 1
wrecks 1
which 1
i 1
abide 2
as 1
means 1
of 1
bliss 1
i 1
gladly 2
will 1
embrace 2
and 1
wish 1
that 1
more 1

greater 2
they 1
might 1

that 1
this 1

that 1
my 1
exceeding 3

not 1

with 1

clear 1
my 1
cloudy 2
grief 1
till 1
then 1
i 1
wander 2
carefull 2
comfortless 3
in 1
secret 2
sorrow 2

sad 1
pensiveness 3
my 1
hungry 2
eyes 1
through 1
greedy 2
covetize 3
still 1
to 1
behold 2
the 1
object 2
of 1
their 1
pain 1

no 1

can 1
themselves 2
suffice 2

having 2
pine 1

having 2
not 1
complain 2
for 1
lacking 2
it 1
they 1
cannot 2
life 1
sustain 2
and 1
having 2
it 1
they 1

narcissus 3
vain 1
whose 1

are 1
mine 1
eyes 1
so 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
store 1
of 1
that 1
fair 1
sight 1
that 1
nothing 2
else 1
they 1
brook 1
but 1
loath 1
the 1
things 1
which 1
they 1
did 1
like 1
before 2

can 1
no 1

these 1
weary 2
woes 1
have 1
end 1
or 1
shall 1
their 1
ruthless 2
torment 2
never 2
cease 1

all 1
my 1
days 1
in 1
pining 2
langor 3
spend 1
without 2
hope 1

release 2
is 1
there 1
no 1

for 1
me 1
to 1
purchase 2
peace 1
or 1
make 1
agreement 3
with 1
her 1
thrilling 2
eyes 1
but 1
that 1
their 1
cruelty 2
doth 1
still 1
increase 2
and 1
daily 2
more 1
augment 2
my 1
miseries 3
but 1
when 1
ye 1
have 1
shewed 2
all 1
extermities 5
then 1
think 1
how 1
little 2
glory 2
ye 1
have 1
gained 1
by 1
slaying 2
him 1
whose 1
life 1
though 1
ye 1
dispise 4
mote 1
have 1
your 1
life 1
in 1
honour 3
long 1
maintained 2
but 1
by 1
his 1
death 1
which 1
some 1
perhaps 2
will 1
moan 1
ye 1
shall 1
condemned 2
be 1
of 1
many 2
a 1
one 1
what 1
guile 1
is 1
this 1
that 1
those 1
her 1
golden 2
tresses 2
she 1
doth 1
attire 3
under 2
a 1
net 1
of 1
gold 1
and 1
with 1
sly 1
skill 1
so 1
cunningly 3
them 1
dresses 2
that 1
which 1
is 1
gold 1
or 1
hair 1
may 1
scarce 1
be 1
told 1
is 1
it 1
that 1
men's 1
frail 1
eyes 1
which 1
gaze 1
too 1
bold 1
she 1
may 1
entangle 3
in 1
that 1
golden 2
snare 1
and 1
being 2
caught 1
may 1
craftily 3
enfold 2
their 1
weaker 2
hearts 1
which 1
are 1
not 1
well 1
aware 2
take 1
heed 1
therefore 2
mine 1
eyes 1
how 1
ye 1
do 1
stare 1
henceforth 2
too 1
rashly 3
on 1
that 1
guileful 3
net 1
in 1
which 1
if 1
ever 2
ye 1
entrapped 2
are 1
out 1
of 1
her 1
bands 1
ye 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
shall 1
get 1
fondness 2
it 1
were 1
for 1
any 2
being 2
free 1
to 1
covet 2
fetters 2
though 1
they 1
golden 2
be 1
arion 3
when 1
through 1
tempests 4
cruel 2
wrack 1
he 1
forth 1
was 1
thrown 1
into 2
the 1
greedy 2
seas 1
through 1
the 1
sweet 1
music 2
which 1
his 1
harp 1
did 1
make 1
allured 2
a 1
dolphin 2
him 1
from 1
death 1
to 1
ease 1
but 1
my 1
rude 1
music 2
which 1
was 1
wont 1
to 1
please 1
some 1
dainty 2
ears 1
cannot 2
with 1
any 2
skill 1
the 1
dreadful 2
tempest 2
of 1
her 1
wrath 1
appease 2
nor 1
move 1
the 1
dolphin 2
from 1
her 1
stubborn 2
will 1
but 1
in 1
her 1
pride 1
she 1
doth 1
persever 3
still 1
all 1
careless 2
how 1
my 1
life 1
for 1
her 1
decays 2
yet 1
with 1
one 1
word 1

save 1

were 1
praise 1

rather 2
to 1
be 1
praised 1
for 1

to 1

spilling 2
guiltless 2

the 1

of 1
the 1
queen 1
of 1
love 1
expressing 3
all 1
thy 1
mother's 2
powerful 3
art 1
with 1
which 1

when 1

on 1
me 1
thou 1
shinedst 3
late 1
in 1
sadness 2
a 1
melting 2
pleasance 4
ran 1
through 1
every 3
part 1

me 1
revived 2
with 1
heart 1
robbing 2
gladness 2
whylest 2
rapt 1
with 1
joy 1
resembling 4
heavenly 3
madness 2
my 1
soul 1
was 1
ravished 3
quite 1
as 1
in 1
a 1
trance 1
and 1
feeling 2
thence 1
no 1
more 1
her 1
sorrow's 2
sadness 2
fed 1
on 1
the 1
fullness 2
of 1
that 1
cheerful 2
glance 1
more 1
sweet 1
than 1
nectar 2
or 1
ambrosial 3
meat 1
seemed 1
every 3
bit 1
which 1
thenceforth 2
i 1
did 1
eat 1
mark 1
when 1
she 1
smiles 1
with 1
amiable 4
cheer 1
and 1
tell 1
me 1
whereto 2
can 1
ye 1
liken 2
it 1
when 1
on 1
each 1
eyelid 2
sweetly 2
do 1
appear 2
an 1
hundred 2
graces 2
as 1
in 1
shade 1
to 1
sit 1
likest 2
it 1
seemeth 3
in 1
my 1
simple 2
wit 1
unto 2
the 1
fair 1
sunshine 2
in 1
summer's 2
day 1
that 1
when 1
a 1
dreadful 2
storm 1
away 2
is 1
flit 1
through 1
the 1
broad 1
world 1
doth 1
spread 1
his 1
goodly 2
ray 1
at 1
sight 1
whereof 2
each 1
bird 1
that 1
sits 1
on 1
spray 1
and 1
every 3
beast 1
that 1
to 1
his 1
den 1
was 1
fled 1
comes 1
forth 1
afresh 2
out 1
of 1
their 1
late 1
dismay 2
and 1
to 1
the 1
light 1
lift 1
up 1
their 1
drooping 2
head 1
so 1
my 1
heart 1
likewise 2
is 1
cheered 1
with 1
that 1
sunshine 2
when 1
cloudy 2
looks 1
are 1
cleared 1
is 1
it 1
her 1
nature 2
or 1
is 1
it 1
her 1
will 1
to 1
be 1
so 1
cruel 2
to 1
an 1
humbled 2
foe 1
if 1
nature 2
then 1
she 1
may 1
it 1
mend 1
with 1
skill 1
if 1
will 1
then 1
she 1
at 1
will 1
may 1
will 1
forgo 2
but 1
if 1
her 1
nature 2
and 1
her 1
will 1
be 1
so 1
that 1
she 1
will 1
plague 1
the 1
man 1
that 1
loves 1
her 1
most 1
and 1
take 1
delight 2
a 1
wretch's 7
woe 1
then 1
all 1
her 1
nature's 2
goodly 2
gifts 1
are 1
lost 1

that 1

glorious 3
beauty's 3
idle 2
boast 1
is 1

a 1
bait 1
such 1
wretches 5
to 1
beguile 2
as 1
being 2
long 1
in 1
her 1
love's 1
tempest 2
tossed 1
she 1

make 1
her 1
piteous 4
spoil 1

fairest 2
fair 1

never 2

the 1

me 1

soon 1
conceive 2

ere 1

thy 1

contrained 4
to 1
utter 2
forth 1
the 1
anguish 2

why 1
are 1
you 1
so 1
fierce 1
and 1
cruel 2
is 1
it 1
because 2
your 1
eyes 1
have 1
power 2
to 1
kill 1

know 1
that 1
mercy 2
is 1
the 1
mightiest 3
jewel 2

greater 2

your 1
pleasure 2

proud 1
will 1
to 1
show 1
the 1
power 2
of 1
your 1
imperious 4

not 1

him 1
that 1
never 2

bend 1
your 1
force 1
against 2
your 1

let 1
them 1
feel 1
of 1
your 1
cruelties 2

double 2
malady 3
of 1
my 1
heart's 1
wound 1
and 1
of 1
my 1
body's 2
grief 1
there 1
came 1
to 1
me 1
a 1
leach 1
that 1
would 1
apply 2
fit 1
medicines 3
for 1
my 1
body's 2
best 1
relief 2
vain 1

of 1

not 1

all 1
the 1
body 2
chief 1
and 1
rules 1
the 1
members 2
as 1
itself 2
doth 1
please 1
then 1
with 1
some 1
cordials 2
seek 1
first 1
to 1
appease 2
the 1
inward 2
langour 3
of 1
my 1
wounded 2
heart 1
and 1
then 1
my 1
body 2
shall 1
have 1
shortly 2
ease 1
but 1
such 1
sweet 1
cordials 2
pass 1
physicians 3

then 1
my 1

leach 1
do 1
you 1
your 1
skill 1
reveal 2

with 1
one 1
salve 1
both 1
heart 1

of 1
purpose 2
made 1
for 1
that 1
they 1
should 1
endure 2
through 1
many 2
ages 2
ne 1
let 1
their 1
famous 2
monuments 3
to 1
fade 1
why 1
then 1
do 1
i 1
untrained 2
in 1
lovers 2
trade 1
her 1
hardness 2
blame 1
which 1
i 1
should 1
more 1
commend 2
sith 3
never 2

to 1
his 1
will 1
allure 2
so 1
do 1
i 1
hope 1
her 1
stubborn 2
heart 1
to 1
bend 1
and 1
that 1
it 1
then 1
more 1
steadfast 2
will 1
endure 2
only 2
my 1
pains 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
more 1
to 1
get 1
her 1

having 2
her 1
my 1
joy 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
greater 2
so 1
oft 1
as 1
homeward 2
i 1
from 1
her 1
depart 2
i 1
go 1
like 1
one 1
that 1
having 2
lost 1
the 1
field 1
is 1
prisoner 3
led 1
away 2
with 1
heavy 2
heart 1
despoiled 4
of 1
warlike 2
arms 1
and 1
knowen 2
shield 1
so 1
do 1
i 1
now 1
myself 2
a 1
prisoner 3
yield 1
to 1
sorrow 2
and 1
to 1
solitary 4
pain 1
from 1
presence 2
of 1
my 1
dearest 2
dear 1
exiled 2
longwhile 2
alone 2
in 1
languor 3
to 1
remain 2
there 1
let 1
no 1
thought 1
of 1
joy 1
or 1
pleasure 2
vain 1
dare 1
to 1
approach 2
that 1
may 1
my 1
solace 2
breed 1
but 1
sudden 2
dumps 1
and 1
dreary 2
sad 1
disdain 2
of 1
all 1
worlds 1
gladness 2
more 1
my 1
torment 2
feed 1
so 1
i 1
her 1
absence 2
will 1
my 1
penance 2
make 1
that 1
of 1
her 1
presence 2
i 1
my 1
mead 1
may 1
take 1
the 1
panther 2
knowing 2
that 1
his 1
spotted 2
hide 1
doth 1
please 1
all 1
beasts 1
but 1
that 1
his 1
looks 1
them 1
fray 1
within 2
a 1
bush 1
his 1
dreadful 2
head 1
doth 1
hide 1
to 1
let 1
thm 3
gaze 1
whilst 1
he 1
on 1
them 1
may 1
prey 1
right 1
so 1
my 1
cruel 2
fair 1
with 1
me 1
doth 1
play 1
for 1
with 1
the 1
goodly 2
semblance 2
of 1
her 1
hue 1
she 1
doth 1
allure 2
me 1
to 1
mine 1
own 1
decay 2
and 1
then 1
no 1
mercy 2
will 1
unto 2
me 1
shew 1
great 1
shame 1
it 1
is 1
thing 1
so 1
divine 2
in 1
view 1
made 1
for 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
world's 1
most 1
ornament 3
to 1
make 1
the 1
bait 1
her 1
gazers 2
to 1
enbrew 2
good 1
shames 1
to 1
be 1
too 1
ill 1
an 1
instrument 3

mercy 2
doth 1
with 1
beauty 2
best 1
agree 2
as 1
in 1
their 1
maker 2
ye 1
them 1
best 1
may 1
see 1
of 1
this 1
world's 1
theatre 3
in 1
which 1
we 1
stay 1
my 1
love 1
like 1
the 1
spectator 3
idly 2
sits 1
beholding 3
me 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
pageants 2
play 1
disguising 3
diversely 5
my 1
troubled 2
wits 1
sometimes 2
i 1
joy 1
when 1
glad 1
occasion 3
fits 1
and 1
mask 1
in 1
mirth 1
like 1
to 1
a 1
comedy 3
soon 1
after 2
when 1
my 1
joy 1
to 1
sorrow 2
flits 2
i 1
wail 1
and 1
make 1
my 1
woes 1
a 1
tragedy 3
yet 1
she 1
beholding 3
me 1
with 1
constant 2
eye 1
delights 2
not 1
in 1
my 1
mirth 1
nor 1
rues 2
my 1
smart 1
but 1
when 1
i 1
laugh 1
she 1
mocks 1
and 1
when 1
i 1
cry 1
she 1
laughs 1
and 1
hardens 2
evermore 3
her 1
heart 1
what 1
then 1
can 1
move 1
her 1
if 1
not 1
mirth 1
nor 1
moan 1
she 1
is 1
no 1
woman 2
but 1
senseless 2
stone 1
so 1
oft 1
as 1
i 1
her 1
beauty 2
do 1
behold 2
and 1
therewith 2
do 1
her 1
cruelty 2
compare 2
i 1
marvel 2
of 1
what 1
substance 2
was 1
the 1
mould 1
the 1
which 1
her 1
made 1
at 1
once 1
so 1
cruel 2
fair 1
not 1
earth 1
for 1
her 1
high 1
thoughts 1
more 1
heavenly 3
are 1
not 1
water 2
for 1
her 1
love 1

burn 1
like 1
fire 2
not 1
air 1
for 1
she 1

not 1
so 1
light 1
or 1
rare 1
not 1
fire 2
for 1
she 1
doth 1
freeze 1
with 1
faint 1
desire 3

needs 1
another 3
element 3
inquire 2
whereof 2
she 1

in 1
all 1

cruel 2

unkind 2

the 1
tiger 2

a 1
storm 1
that 1
all 1

prostrate 2
finding 2

see 1
between 2
the 1
spider 2
and 1
the 1
gentle 2
bee 1
oft 1
when 1
my 1
spirit 2
doth 1
spread 1
her 1
bolder 2
wings 1
in 1
mind 1
to 1
mount 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
purest 2
sky 1
it 1
down 1
is 1
weighed 1
with 1
thought 1
of 1
earthly 2
things 1
and 1
clogged 1
with 1
burden 2
of 1
mortality 4
where 1
when 1
that 1
sovereign 2
beauty 2
it 1
doth 1
spy 1
resembling 4
heaven's 2
glory 2
in 1
her 1
light 1
drawn 1
with 1
sweet 1
pleasure's 3
bait 1
it 1
back 1
doth 1
fly 1
and 1
unto 2
heaven 2
forgets 2
her 1
former 2
flight 1
there 1
my 1
frail 1
fancy 2
fed 1
with 1
full 1
delight 2
doth 1
bathe 1
in 1
bliss 1
and 1
mantleth 3
most 1
at 1
ease 1
ne 1
thinks 1
of 1
other 2
heaven 2
but 1
how 1
it 1
might 1
her 1
heart's 1
desire 3
with 1
most 1
contentment 3
please 1
heart 1
need 1
not 1
with 1
none 1
other 2
happiness 3
but 1
here 1
on 1
earth 1
to 1
have 1
such 1
heaven's 2
bliss 1
being 2
myself 2
captured 2
here 1
in 1
care 1
my 1
heart 1
whom 1
none 1
with 1
servile 2
bands 1
can 1
tie 1
but 1
the 1
fair 1
tresses 2
of 1
your 1
golden 2
hair 1
breaking 2
his 1
prison 2
forth 1
to 1
you 1
doth 1
fly 1
like 1
as 1
a 1
bird 1
that 1
in 1
one's 1
hand 1
doth 1
spy 1
desired 3
food 1
to 1
it 1
doth 1
make 1
his 1
flight 1
even 2
so 1
my 1
heart 1
that 1
wont 1
on 1
your 1
fair 1
eye 1
to 1
feed 1
his 1
fill 1
flys 2
back 1
unto 2
your 1
sight 1
do 1
you 1
him 1
take 1
and 1
in 1
your 1
bosom 2
bright 1
gently 2
encage 2
that 1
he 1
may 1
be 1
your 1
thrall 1
perhaps 2
he 1
there 1
may 1
learn 1
with 1
rare 1
delight 2
to 1
sing 1
your 1
name 1
and 1
praises 2
over 2
all 1
that 1
it 1
hereafter 3
may 1
you 1
not 1
repent 2
him 1
lodging 2
in 1
your 1
bosom 2
to 1
have 1
lent 1
most 1
happy 2
letters 2
by 1
skillful 2
trade 1
with 1
which 1
that 1
happy 2
name 1
was 1
first 1
designed 2
the 1
which 1
three 1
times 1
thrice 1
happy 2
hath 1
me 1
made 1
with 1
gifts 1
of 1

by 1
whom 1
my 1

unto 2

her 1
name 1
upon 2
the 1
strand 1

came 1

waves 1
and 1
washed 1
it 1
away 2
again 2

wrote 1
it 1
with 1
a 1
second 2
hand 1
but 1
came 1
the 1
tide 1
and 1
made 1
my 1
pains 1
his 1
prey 1

how 1
was 1
i 1
ravished 3
with 1
your 1
lovely 2
sight 1
and 1
my 1
frail 1
thoughts 1
too 1
rashly 3
led 1
astray 2
whiles 1
diving 2
deep 1
through 1
amorous 3
insight 2
on 1
the 1
sweet 1

of 1
beauty 2

fruit 1
in 1
may 1

harvest 2
seemed 1
to 1
hasten 2

loosly 2
did 1
their 1
wanton 2
wings 1

there 1
to 1
rest 1
themselves 2
did 1
boldly 2
place 1
sweet 1

your 1
so 1
happy 2

which 1
oft 1
i 1
wished 1

never 2
was 1
so 1
blest 1
was 1
it 1
a 1
dream 1
or 1
did 1
i 1
see 1
it 1
plain 1
a 1
goodly 2
table 2
of 1
pure 1
ivory 3
all 1
spread 1
with 1
juncats 2
fit 1
to 1
entertain 3
the 1
greatest 2
prince 1
with 1
pompous 2
royalty 3
mongst 3
which 1
there 1
in 1
a 1
silver 2
dish 1
did 1
lie 1
two 1
golden 2
apples 2
of 1
unvalued 3
price 1
far 1
passing 2
those 1
which 1
hercules 3
came 1
by 1
or 1
those 1
which 1
atalanta 4
did 1
entice 2
exceeding 3
sweet 1
yet 1
void 1
of 1
sinful 2
vice 1
that 1
many 2
sought 1
yet 1
none 1
could 1
ever 2
taste 1
sweet 1
fruit 1
of 1
pleasure 2
brought 1
from 1
paradise 3
by 1
love 1
himself 2
and 1
in 1
his 1
garden 2
placed 1
her 1
breast 1
that 1
table 2
was 1
so 1
richly 2
spread 1
my 1
thoughts 1
the 1
guests 1
which 1
would 1
thereon 2
have 1
fed 1
lacking 2
my 1
love 1
i 1
go 1
from 1
place 1
to 1
place 1
like 1
a 1
young 1
fawn 1
that 1
late 1
hath 1
lost 1
the 1
hind 1
and 1
seek 1
each 1
where 1
where 1
last 1
i 1
saw 1
her 1
face 1
whose 1
image 2
yet 1
i 1
carry 2
fresh 1
in 1
mind 1
i 1
seek 1
the 1
fields 1
with 1
her 1
late 1
footing 2
signed 1
i 1
seek 1
her 1
bower 2
with 1
her 1
late 1
presence 2
decked 1
yet 1
nor 1
in 1
field 1
nor 1
bower 2
i 1
her 1
can 1
find 1
yet 1
field 1
and 1
bower 2
are 1
full 1
of 1
her 1
aspect 2
but 1
when 1
mine 1
eyes 1
i 1
thereunto 3
direct 2
they 1
idly 2
back 1
return 2
to 1
me 1
again 2
and 1
when 1
i 1
hope 1
to 1
see 1
their 1
true 1
object 2
i 1
find 1
myself 2
but 1
fed 1
with 1
fancies 2
vain 1
cease 1
then 1
mine 1
eyes 1
to 1
seek 1
herself 2
to 1
see 1
and 1
let 1
my 1
thoughts 1
behold 2
herself 2
in 1
me 1
men 1
call 1
you 1
fair 1
and 1
you 1
do 1
credit 2
it 1
for 1
that 1
yourself 2
ye 1
daily 2
such 1
do 1
see 1
but 1
the 1
true 1
fair 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
gentle 2
wit 1
and 1
virtuous 3
mind 1
is 1
much 1
more 1
prayed 1
of 1
me 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
rest 1
how 1
ever 2
fair 1
it 1
be 1
shall 1
turn 1
to 1
naught 1
and 1
loose 1
that 1
glorious 3
hue 1
but 1
only 2
that 1
is 1
permanent 3
and 1
free 1
from 1
frail 1
corruption 3
that 1
doth 1
flesh 1
ensue 2
that 1
is 1
true 1
beauty 2
that 1
doth 1
argue 2
you 1
to 1
be 1
divine 2
and 1
born 1
of 1
heavenly 3
seed 1
from 1
that 1
fair 1
spirit 2
from 1
whom 1
all 1
true 1
and 1
perfect 2
beauty 2
did 1
at 1
first 1
proceed 2
he 1
only 2
fair 1
and 1
what 1
he 1
fair 1
hath 1
made 1
all 1
other 2
fair 1
like 1
flowers 2
untimely 3
fade 1
after 2
so 1
long 1
a 1
race 1
as 1
i 1
have 1
run 1
through 1
faery 3
land 1
which 1
those 1
six 1
books 1
compile 2
give 1
leave 1
to 1
rest 1
me 1
being 2
half 1
fordone 2
and 1
gather 2
to 1
myself 2
new 1
breath 1
awhile 2
then 1
as 1
a 1
steed 1
refreshed 2
after 2
toil 1
out 1
of 1
my 1
prison 2
i 1
will 1
break 1
anew 2
and 1
stoutly 2
will 1
that 1
second 2
work 1
assoyle 3
with 1
strong 1
endeavor 3
and 1
attention 3
due 1
till 1
then 1
give 1
leave 1
to 1
me 1
in 1
pleasant 2
mew 1
to 1
sport 1
my 1
muse 1
and 1
sing 1
my 1
love's 1
sweet 1
praise 1
the 1
contemplation 4
of 1
whose 1
heavenly 3
hue 1
my 1
spirit 2
to 1
an 1
higher 2
pitch 1
will 1
raise 1
but 1
let 1
her 1
praises 2
yet 1
be 1
low 1
and 1
mean 1
fit 1
for 1
the 1
handmaid 2
of 1
the 1
faery 3
queene 3
fair 1
is 1
my 1
love 1
when 1
her 1
fair 1
golden 2
heares 2
with 1
the 1
loose 1
wind 1
ye 1
waving 2
chance 1
to 1
mark 1
fair 1
when 1
the 1
rose 1
in 1
her 1
red 1
cheeks 1
appears 2
or 1
in 1
her 1
eyes 1
the 1
fire 2
of 1
love 1
does 1
spark 1
fair 1
when 1
her 1
breast 1
like 1
a 1
bark 1
with 1
precious 2
merchandise 3
she 1
forth 1
doth 1
lay 1
fair 1
when 1
that 1
cloud 1
of 1
pride 1
which 1
oft 1
doth 1
dark 1
her 1
goodly 2
light 1
with 1
smiles 1
she 1
drives 1
away 2
but 1
fairest 2
she 1
when 1
so 1
she 1
doth 1
display 2
the 1
gate 1
with 1
pearls 1
and 1
rubies 2
richly 2
dight 3
through 1
which 1
her 1
words 1
so 1
wise 1
do 1
make 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
bear 1
the 1
message 2
of 1
her 1
gentle 2
sprite 1
the 1
rest 1
be 1
works 1
of 1
nature's 2
wonderment 3
but 1
this 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
heart's 1
astonishment 4
joy 1
of 1
my 1
life 1
full 1
oft 1
for 1
loving 2
you 1
i 1
bless 1
my 1
lot 1
that 1
was 1
so 1
lucky 2
placed 1
but 1
then 1
the 1
more 1
your 1
own 1
mishap 2
i 1
rue 1
that 1
are 1
so 1
much 1
by 1
so 1
mean 1
love 1
debased 2
for 1
had 1
the 1
equal 2
heavens 2
so 1
much 1
you 1
graced 1
in 1
this 1
as 1
in 1
the 1
rest 1
ye 1
mote 1
invent 2
soom 3
heavenly 3
wit 1
whose 1
verse 1
could 1
have 1
enchased 2
your 1
glorious 3
name 1
in 1
golden 2
monument 3
but 1
since 1
ye 1
deigned 1
so 1
goodly 2
to 1
relent 2
to 1
me 1
your 1
thrall 1
in 1
whom 1
is 1
little 2
worth 1
that 1
little 2
that 1
i 1
am 1
shall 1
all 1
be 1
spent 1
in 1
setting 2
your 1
immoral 3
praises 2
forth 1
whose 1
lofty 2
argument 3
uplifting 3
me 1
shall 1
lift 1
you 1
up 1
unto 2
an 1
high 1
degree 2
my 1
hungry 2
eyes 1
through 1
greedy 2
covetize 3
still 1
to 1
behold 2
the 1
object 2
of 1
their 1
pain 1
with 1
no 1
contentment 3
can 1
themselves 2
suffice 2
but 1
having 2
pine 1
and 1
having 2
not 1
complain 2
for 1
lacking 2
it 1
they 1
cannot 2
life 1
sustain 2
and 1
seeing 2
it 1
they 1
gaze 1
on 1
it 1
the 1
more 1
in 1
their 1
amazement 3
like 1
narcissus 3
vain 1
whose 1
eyes 1
him 1
so 1
plenty 2
makes 1
me 1
poor 1
yet 1
are 1
mine 1
eyes 1
so 1
filled 1
with 1
the 1
store 1
of 1
that 1
fair 1
sight 1
that 1
nothing 2
else 1
they 1
brook 1
but 1
loath 1
the 1
things 1
which 1
they 1
did 1
like 1
before 2
and 1
can 1
no 1
more 1
endure 2
on 1
them 1
to 1
look 1
all 1
this 1
world's 1
glory 2
seemeth 3
vain 1
to 1
me 1
and 1
all 1
their 1
shows 1
but 1
shadows 2
saving 2
she 1
let 1
not 1
one 1
spark 1
of 1
filthy 2
lustfull 2
fire 2
ne 1
one 1
light 1
glance 1
of 1
sensual 3
desire 3
attempt 2
to 1
work 1
her 1
gentle 2
mind's 1
unrest 2
but 1
pure 1
affections 3
bred 1
in 1
spotless 2
breast 1
and 1
modest 2
thoughts 1
breathed 1
from 1
well 1
tempered 2
sprites 2
go 1
visit 2
her 1
in 1
her 1
chaste 1
bower 2
of 1
rest 1
accompanied 4
with 1
angelic 3
delights 2
there 1
fill 1
yourself 2
with 1
those 1
most 1
joyous 2
sights 1
the 1
which 1
myself 2
could 1
never 2
yet 1
attain 2
but 1
speak 1
no 1
word 1
to 1
her 1
of 1
these 1
sad 1
plights 2
which 1
her 1
too 1
constant 2
stiffness 2
doth 1
constrain 2
only 2
behold 2
her 1
rare 1
perfection 3
and 1
bless 1
your 1
fortune's 2
fair 1
election 3
the 1
world 1
that 1
cannot 2
deem 1
of 1
worthy 2
things 1
when 1
i 1
do 1
praise 1
her 1
say 1
i 1
do 1
but 1
flatter 2
so 1
does 1
the 1
cuckoo 2
when 1
the 1
mavis 2
sings 1
begin 2
his 1
witless 2
note 1
apace 2
to 1
clatter 2
but 1
they 1
that 1
skill 1
not 1
of 1
so 1
heavenly 3
matter 2
all 1
that 1
they 1
know 1
not 1
envy 2
or 1
admire 2
rather 2
than 1
envy 2
let 1
them 1
wonder 2
at 1
her 1
but 1
not 1
to 1
deem 1
of 1
her 1
desert 2
aspire 2
deep 1
in 1
the 1
closet 2
of 1
my 1
parts 1
entire 3
her 1
worth 1
is 1
written 2
with 1
a 1
golden 2
quill 1
that 1
me 1
with 1
heavenly 3
fury 2
doth 1
inspire 2
and 1
my 1
glad 1
mouth 1
with 1
her 1
sweet 1
praises 2
fill 1
which 1
when 1
as 1
fame 1
in 1
her 1
shrill 1
trump 1
shall 1
thunder 2
let 1
the 1
world 1
choose 1
to 1
envy 2
or 1
to 1
wonder 2
venemous 4
tongue 1
tipped 1
with 1
vile 1
adders 2
sting 1
of 1
that 1
self 1
kind 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
furies 3
fell 1
their 1
snaky 4
heads 1
do 1
comb 1
from 1
which 1
a 1
spring 1
of 1
poisoned 2
words 1
and 1
spiteful 2
speeches 2
well 1
let 1
all 1
the 1
plagues 1
and 1
horrid 2
pains 1
of 1
hell 1
upon 2
thee 1
fall 1
for 1
thine 1
accursed 6
hire 2
that 1
with 1
lies 1
which 1
thou 1
didst 2
tell 1
in 1
my 1
true 1
love 1
did 1
stir 1
up 1
coals 1
of 1
ire 1
the 1
sparks 1
whereof 2
let 1
kindle 2
thine 1
own 1
fire 2
and 1
catching 2
hold 1
on 1
thine 1
own 1
wicked 2
head 1
consume 2
thee 1
quite 1
that 1
didst 2
with 1
guile 1
conspire 3
in 1
my 1
sweet 1
peace 1
such 1
breaches 2
to 1
have 1
bred 1
shame 1
be 1
thy 1
meed 2
and 1
mischief 2
thy 1
reward 2
due 1
to 1
thyself 2
that 1
it 1
for 1
me 1
prepared 2
since 1
i 1
did 1
leave 1
the 1
presence 2
of 1
my 1
love 1
many 2
long 1
weary 2
days 1
have 1
i 1
outworn 2
and 1
many 2
nights 1
that 1
slowly 2
seemed 1
to 1
move 1
their 1
sad 1
protract 2
from 1
evening 2
until 2
morn 1
for 1
when 1
as 1
day 1
the 1
heaven 2
doth 1
adorn 2
i 1
wish 1
that 1
night 1
the 1
noyous 2
day 1
would 1
end 1
and 1
when 1
as 1
night 1
hath 1
us 1
of 1
light 1
forlorn 2
i 1
wish 1
that 1
day 1
would 1
shortly 2
reascend 3
thus 1
i 1
the 1
time 1
with 1
expectation 4
spend 1
and 1
fain 1
my 1
grief 1
with 1
changes 2
to 1
beguile 2
that 1
further 2
seems 1
his 1
term 1
still 1
to 1
extend 2
and 1
maketh 3
every 3
minute 2
seem 1
a 1
mile 1
so 1
sorrow 2
still 1
doth 1
seem 1
too 1
long 1
to 1
last 1
but 1
joyous 2
hours 2
do 1
fly 1
away 2
too 1
fast 1
since 1
i 1
have 1
lacked 1
the 1
comfort 2
of 1
that 1
light 1
the 1
which 1
was 1
wont 1
to 1
lead 1
my 1
thoughts 1
astray 2
i 1
wander 2
as 1
in 1
darkness 2
of 1
the 1
night 1
afraid 2
of 1
every 3
danger's 3
least 1
dismay 2
ne 1
ought 1
i 1
see 1
though 1
in 1
the 1
clearest 2
day 1
when 1
others 2
gaze 1
upon 2
their 1
shadows 2
vain 1
but 1
image 2
of 1
that 1
heavenly 3
ray 1
whereof 2
some 1
glance 1
doth 1
in 1
mine 1
eye 1
remain 2
of 1
which 1
beholding 3
the 1
idea 3
plain 1
through 1
contemplation 4
of 1
my 1
purest 2
part 1
with 1
light 1
thereof 2
i 1
do 1
myself 2
sustain 2
and 1
thereon 2
feed 1
my 1
heart 1
but 1
with 1
such 1
brightness 2
whilst 1
i 1
fill 1
my 1
mind 1
i 1
starve 1
my 1
body 2
and 1
mine 1
eyes 1
do 1
blind 1
like 1
as 1
the 1
culver 2
on 1
the 1
bared 1
bough 1
sits 1
mourning 2
for 1
the 1
absence 2
of 1
her 1
mate 1
and 1
in 1
her 1
songs 1
sends 1
many 2
a 1
wishful 2
vow 1
for 1
his 1
return 2
that 1
seems 1
to 1
linger 2
late 1
so 1
i 1
alone 2
now 1
left 1
disconsolate 5
mourn 1
to 1
myself 2
the 1
absence 2
of 1
my 1
love 1
and 1
wandering 3
here 1
and 1
there 1
all 1
desolate 3
seek 1
with 1
my 1
plaints 4
to 1
match 1
that 1
mournful 2
dove 1
ne 1
joy 1
of 1
aught 4
that 1
under 2
heaven 2
doth 1
hove 1
can 1
comfort 2
me 1
but 1
her 1
own 1
joyous 2
sight 1
whose 1
sweet 1
aspect 2
both 1
god 1
and 1
man 1
can 1
move 1
in 1
her 1
unspotted 3
pleasauns 4
to 1
delight 2
dark 1
is 1
my 1
day 1
while 1
her 1
